## 2026-10-24 — Home page / school model load speed

- **Model was mostly wasted geometry:** of ~1.9M vertices, `flower.001` (small
  flower bed) had 818k and `Robot.025` (hidden in code) was still shipped.
  `tools/optimize-school-glb.mjs` simplifies the flower bed (meshopt, checked by
  screenshot) and drops the robot → `school-v2.glb` 9.8→7.0MB,
  `school-mobile-v2.glb` 5.3→3.9MB. `Box007` (engine housing, 762k verts) can't
  be simplified — it's all hard-edge/colour seams — so it's kept as is.
- **HDR** 1k→512 (`tools/downscale_hdr.py`): 1.3MB→0.37MB, no visible change.
- **Preload:** Hero emits `<link rel="preload" as="fetch" crossorigin>` for the
  GLB (per-screen via `media`), Draco decoder and HDR, so they download with the
  HTML instead of after hydration + the ~1MB three.js chunk. Verified one GLB
  request (preload reused). Throttled 12Mbps: GLB starts at ~0.1s, done at 5.8s
  desktop / 3.5s mobile.
- New filenames because `.glb/.hdr` are served `immutable` — URLs now live in
  `src/components/landing/schoolModelAssets.ts`; bump `-vN` on re-export.
- Below-the-fold home images `loading="lazy"`; Geist Mono no longer preloaded.

---

## 2026-10-24 — Mobile Chrome reloads when the home model is swiped up/down

- **Cause:** the model area used `touch-action: pan-y`, so Chrome owned every
  vertical swipe. At the top of the page a downward swipe became
  **pull-to-refresh** (page reload) and the pointer drag was cancelled, so the
  model never tilted.
- **Fix (`SchoolModelBanner.tsx`):** `touch-action: none` + `overscroll-behavior:
  contain` on the model area, and a touch axis-lock in `moveDrag`: horizontal
  swipe = spin, vertical swipe = tilt, and the part of a vertical swipe the
  clamped tilt can't absorb is passed to `window.scrollBy`, so the page still
  scrolls over the model (no momentum fling there). Also dropped the orb
  button's own `onPointerMove`, which double-counted moves with the wrapper's.
- Home drag control is now an "arc reactor" orb (blue liquid fills with drag,
  white-hot at 100%), replacing the hamburger-looking handle.

---

## 2026-10-13 — Mobile 3D reload/slow load + client change list (menus, home, footer)

- **Mobile reload / load time:** `school.glb` has one mesh with ~641k tris
  (~34MB GPU) plus 20× 1024² textures (~110MB VRAM) — enough to OOM-kill a
  phone tab, which the browser then reloads. Added `public/models/school-mobile.glb`
  (gltf-transform `simplify --ratio 0.25 --error 0.002`, `resize 512`, `draco`):
  9.8→5.3MB, that mesh 34→11.7MB GPU. `SchoolModelBanner` loads it below 768px.
- Model: bigger on desktop (fit 9.2, phones 7.6 so edges don't clip), one-time
  grow/rise/swing-in intro after load, "Drag To View" centred under the model.
- Header/footer links now come from `src/lib/siteNav.ts`. New menu pages without
  content yet render `InfoPage` from `src/lib/infoPages.ts`
  (`/academic/[slug]`, `/events/[slug]`, `/about/educators`, `/admission/prospectus`).
- Home: removed Visions; "Innovation" → "Life At Garima" (4 photos,
  Admin → Site Images `home_life_1..4`); Knowledge Partners (`home_partner_1..8`,
  hidden until a logo is uploaded); Gallery (latest 8 from `gallery` table);
  Journey 1988/2007/2024/2025. Removed `/about/strength` site-wide.

---

## 2026-06-26 — Optimization batch 3 + hero sky discovery

- **#2 school.glb textures 2048→1024:** 11.5→9MB (identical at hero scale).
- **#4 lab.mp4 1440p→1080p** all-intra crf26: 7.3→6MB (lighter mobile decode).
- **#6 removed unused deps:** `leva`, `@react-three/postprocessing` (0 imports;
  postprocessing freed by the bloom revert). `npm uninstall`, build still green.
- **#5/#9:** three.js already code-split (academic `dynamic`, robotics no 3D);
  `next/font` already swaps — made `display:"swap"` explicit.
- **HERO SUNSET SKY:** the home hero's intended background (`hero-bg.webp`, a
  sunset sky matching the artist render) had **never loaded** — its original file
  `ChatGPT Image Jun 5, 2026, 01_07_51 PM.png` (spaces+commas) silently failed in
  `next start` (same bug as Group 9.png). Converting to `hero-bg.webp` made it
  load. **User chose to KEEP the sky** (matches reference render #5). The
  dark-blue look was the broken fallback.
- **#1 static-image hero — not done (impractical):** the 3D hero's camera is
  fixed, so the model's screen position/size varies per viewport aspect; a single
  static overlay would misalign across devices. The sky bg now gives the
  instant-paint benefit anyway (sky+clouds paint immediately while the model
  loads). #3 manual preload skipped (useGLTF.preload already prefetches; bad
  preload key = double download).

Home payload now ~12MB real (was ~29MB at session start); public/ 93→35MB.

## 2026-06-26 — Robot-assembly scrub section goes black on mobile

**Symptom:** robot-assembly `ScrubVideo` sometimes doesn't load, or loads then
goes black on scroll (mobile/responsive).

**Cause:** (1) a *paused* `<video>` scrolled out of view gets its decoded frame
evicted by mobile browsers → black (no poster). (2) lazy-load gate only fired on
scroll, so a reload already-scrolled-near-it never triggered load.

**Fix (`ScrubVideo.jsx`):** added `poster` prop — set as the `<video poster>` AND
the section `background-image` (so it's never pure black, falls back to frame 1).
Posters: `public/{robot_assembly,lab}_poster.webp` (34/100KB), passed from
`GarimaImpact.tsx` + `robotics/page.js`. Also added a safe one-shot
`setTimeout(check,1200)` initial load check (scrollY>0 guard keeps it from
loading at the top). Verify on real device.

---

## 2026-06-26 — Bloom revert + asset optimization pass 2

- **Reverted bloom** (it blew out the school model / made the canvas container
  visible) — removed `EffectComposer`/`Bloom`, exposure 1.2→1.05, dropped
  `environmentIntensity`. Back to the prior (better) look.
- **Local PNGs → WebP** (`ghj`, `scc`, `io-copy`, `main-object-1`, `hero-bg` ex
  "ChatGPT Image…", `group-9`): **~7.2MB → ~0.6MB**. Updated all refs.
- **Group 9.png 404:** `next start` won't serve filenames with **spaces**
  (`url('/Group%209.png')`). Converted → `group-9.webp`, fixed bg ref.
- **Unsplash → self-hosted WebP:** 8 images downloaded to `public/img/*.webp`
  (724KB total), URLs rewritten in 4 pages. One photo
  (`photo-1523050854058…`) is **404 on Unsplash** (was already broken live) →
  aliased to a working school image.
- **`robot_assembly.webm` → `.mp4`** (H.264 all-intra, faststart): 8.8→6.8MB,
  hardware-decoded. Ref updated in `GarimaImpact.tsx`. Already lazy-loaded.
- **Cleanup:** public/ **93MB → 38MB** (removed unused originals; backups in
  `tools/_backups/unused_public/`).
- Tex-downscale preview (school.glb textures 2048→1024 = 11.5→9.8MB) is visually
  identical at hero scale but only ~1.7MB — left undeployed pending decision.

## 2026-06-26 — School model "missing resources" look + UI fixes + asset cleanup

- **"Missing resources" school model:** NOT a stripped-asset bug — current
  `school.glb` is structurally identical to original (same emissive/specular
  exts, 22 mats, 23 textures). It's a *rendering* gap vs the artist's offline
  render: no bloom + cool exposure made the emissive wood slats render flat.
  Fix in `SchoolModelBanner.tsx`: added `@react-three/postprocessing` **Bloom**
  (mipmapBlur, threshold 0.65, intensity 0.7), exposure 1.05→1.2,
  `environmentIntensity={1.25}`. Slats + cyan thrusters now glow like the ref.
  (Note: postprocessing v3.0.4 uses `enableNormalPass`, not `disableNormalPass`.)
- **Drag-model button offscreen** (had to scroll): was in normal flow below the
  680px hero. Moved to `absolute top-[62%] right-[7%] sm:top-[58%]` overlay →
  in view on desktop (top 708<768) + mobile. 
- **Lab overlay text:** removed `title="INSIDE THE LAB"` (robotics page); moved
  the `[ SCROLL TO EXPLORE ]` caption from dead-centre to `absolute bottom-10`
  in `ScrubVideo.jsx`.
- **Clouds "take 15-20s":** false alarm — big cloud is `claud_clean.webp` (30KB),
  small clouds 0.27+0.11MB; clouds are instant. The 15-20s is the 11MB
  `school.glb` decode (clouds just paint first). CSS drift anim is free.
- **Asset cleanup:** removed ~45MB unused files from `public/` (claud.png 6MB,
  `models/mainn.glb` 16MB, `models/school_original.glb` 16.7MB, vid.webm, io.png,
  etc. — exact-grep confirmed 0 refs). public/ 93→48MB. Backups in
  `tools/_backups/unused_public/`.

---

## 2026-06-26 — /academic slow load + iPhone character cutoff

- **Slow load:** `boy.glb` was **completely uncompressed** (12.8MB, no Draco/meshopt,
  no textures — pure geometry, 3 anims clap/idle/wave). →
  `gltf-transform optimize --compress draco --simplify false --texture-compress false`
  → **12.8MB → 1.95MB** (anims preserved; joined 108→37 meshes, palette-merged
  mats). With `robot.glb` (1.76MB), `/academic` model payload **~14.6MB → ~3.7MB**.
  Verified renders correctly desktop + mobile. Original in `tools/_backups/`.
- **iPhone cutoff:** `AcademicScene.tsx` camera was fixed at `z=200`; on portrait
  the two characters (~±46u wide) overflowed the narrow frustum and got cut. Fix:
  **dolly the camera back as aspect narrows** — `dist = max(200, (sep+46) /
  (tan(vfov/2)·aspect))` — so both stay fully on-screen. Landscape hits the z=200
  floor → desktop framing unchanged. Verified iPhone (390×844) + desktop.

---

## 2026-06-25 — Load-time optimization pass (home 10s / lab 15s LOCAL → much faster)

User clarified the 10-15s was **localhost** (processing), tunnel adds more
(download). Measured payloads (`tools/sizes.mjs`) + GLB composition
(`gltf-transform inspect`). Findings + fixes:

- **`school.glb` = 8.5M verts / 280 meshes, Draco.** Heavy decode + GPU upload +
  shader compile. → `gltf-transform optimize --compress draco` (joins meshes too).
  ⚠️ **First attempt `--simplify-error 0.008` GARBLED the building's "GARIMA VIDHYA
  VIHAR SR SCHOOL" text** (0.8% of the ~540u bbox ≈ 4u > letter features → letters
  collapsed: "ARIMA … /R /CHODL"). **Fix: tighten error to `0.0005`** — the error
  bound (not the ratio) protects fine detail, so flat areas still decimate hard
  while text stays crisp. Final: `--simplify-ratio 0.3 --simplify-error 0.0005
  --texture-size 2048` → **16.7MB → 10MB**, text legible (verified by rotating the
  model to its back: `tools/textcheck.mjs`). Self-hosted Draco path kept.
  **Lesson: GLB simplify-error must be tight enough to preserve text/decals;
  always verify text-bearing faces, not just the hero angle.**
- **`robot.glb`** (lab) Draco 3.8MB → **meshopt 1.7MB** (meshopt decoder is
  bundled, fast).
- **`claud_clean.png` 3.2MB** (hero cloud, shown ≤600px, was 2816px) → **WebP w/
  alpha 30KB** (`SchoolModelBanner.tsx` src → `/claud_clean.webp`).
- **Scrub videos eagerly downloaded on load** (`robot_assembly.webm` 8.6MB on
  HOME; `lab.mp4` 7.3MB on robotics). → `ScrubVideo.jsx` now lazy-loads: `src`
  gated by `shouldLoad`, set via a **scroll-position** check (NOT
  IntersectionObserver/timeout — both fire during the dynamic ssr:false hero's
  unstable initial layout and falsely load). Loads when section within 2
  viewports; verified deferred at top, loads+scrubs on scroll.

Result: **home initial payload ~29MB → ~14MB** (5MB + 9MB model; robot video
deferred), school model decode much faster (¼ geometry). Backups parked in
`tools/_backups/`. Still TODO: re-encode `robot_assembly.webm` to H.264/MP4
1080p all-intra like lab.mp4; lazy-load/defer `school.glb` further if needed.

## 2026-06-25 — ROOT CAUSE of "~1 min load, no scroll until it loads" (PC + mobile)

**Symptom:** school model takes a minute+, lab first-load breaks, no scroll until
it finally loads — on PC and mobile, not a caching issue.

**Root cause (found via network instrumentation, `tools/netdiag.mjs`):** the 3D
scene fetched **external CDN assets that hang on some ISPs/regions**, and R3F
`<Suspense>` blocks the scene (and the page becoming interactive/scrollable) until
they resolve:
- `<Environment preset="sunset">` (drei) → HDR from `raw.githack.com` **and**
  `raw.githubusercontent.com` (the githubusercontent one was **still PENDING after
  8s** even on a good connection).
- Draco decoder for the Draco-compressed `school.glb` → `www.gstatic.com/draco/...`
  (`draco_wasm_wrapper.js` + `draco_decoder.wasm`). Without it the model can't
  decompress. `robot.glb` hit the same path.

Browser fetches these **directly** (not via the Cloudflare tunnel), so the tunnel
was a red herring; the hang is the external CDNs.

**Fix — self-host everything:**
- `public/hdri/venice_sunset_1k.hdr`; `SchoolModelBanner.tsx` →
  `<Environment files="/hdri/venice_sunset_1k.hdr">` (not `preset`).
- `public/draco/{draco_wasm_wrapper.js,draco_decoder.wasm}` (v1.5.5 to match drei);
  pass local decoder path to every `useGLTF(..., '/draco/')` +
  `useGLTF.preload(..., '/draco/')` in `SchoolModelBanner`, `RobotShowcase`,
  `Character`.
- `next.config.ts` `headers()` long-cache extended to `glb|gltf|hdr|wasm` too.

**Verified (`tools/netdiag.mjs`):** home + `/robotics` now make **0 external
requests**; all assets 200 from local origin; model renders w/ HDR lighting; no
errors. This removes the multi-second/minute stall on every network.

## 2026-06-25 — Lab fly-through re-rendered: 1440p, Cycles, Orbitron fonts

**Goal:** old `public/lab.webm` was 720p EEVEE, dull/pixelated, plain fonts.

**What was done**
- **Engine:** benchmarked — Cycles on **CPU (dual Xeon, 88 threads) = 42.7s/frame
  @1080p**, beating EEVEE/GPU (59.5s) and Cycles/GPU (736s — 8GB VRAM thrash).
  Render on CPU, never GPU, for this 15.3M-tri scene. (See `tools/_bench` notes.)
- **Camera:** kept the **original** animation (built a Hybrid 8-station tour first;
  user rejected it). Matched the existing webm's **120 frames / 24fps / 5s**,
  sampled evenly from the original 372-frame path (old `render_lab.py` had wrongly
  truncated 372→360 @30fps).
- **Fonts:** labels were baked text-meshes (9 `typeMesh*`, no font datablock).
  Rebuilt each as a real text object in **Orbitron** (`../fonts/Orbitron.ttf`).
  Tamed over-bright emission (TEXT_GLOW 10→3.5, sign `lambert7.001` 50→7,
  subtitle `lambert7` 5→2.2). Hero title+subtitle placed at ABSOLUTE positions
  inside sign plate `lab_4:pCube32` (z[0.298..0.368]) so they can't overflow.
- **Output:** 2560×1440 PNG (Cycles 64spp) → VP9 24fps, `eq=saturation=1.25`.
  Backed up old as `public/lab_old720_backup.webm`.
- **Scrub-smoothness bug + fix:** first encode used VP9 default GOP → **only 1
  keyframe**, so `ScrubVideo` (`src/components/shared/ScrubVideo.jsx`) seeks
  (`video.currentTime = progress*duration`, and skips updates while
  `video.seeking`) had to decode from frame 0 every seek → stuttered and stalled
  ~3.3s, never reaching the end. **Fix: re-encode ALL-INTRA (`-g 1 -keyint_min 1`)
  — every frame a keyframe (matches the old video's 120 keyframes)** → instant
  seeks, smooth 0→5.0s monotonic ramp. crf30→27MB, crf34→**21MB (shipped)**,
  crf38→17MB. Rule: scroll-scrubbed clips MUST be all-intra.
- **STILL laggy + slow load after all-intra:** 1440p **VP9 software-decodes**
  in browsers (no HW path) → heavy per-seek decode = lag on PC + mobile; 21MB =
  late load. **Fix: switch to H.264/MP4 @1080p, all-intra, `+faststart`.** H.264
  hardware-decodes everywhere; 1080p cuts decode cost; smaller file loads fast.
  `public/lab.mp4` = 1080p H.264 all-intra **11.4MB**; page `src` → `/lab.mp4`
  (`src/app/robotics/page.js`). Removed unused `public/lab.webm`. Verified
  `tools/caprobotics.mjs`: currentTime 0→5.0 monotonic, seeking=false.
  Takeaway: scrub clips = **H.264 MP4, ~1080p, all-intra, faststart** (not VP9).
- **"Slow load + no scroll over garima.tinu.pro (Cloudflare tunnel)":** NOT a
  code bug — localhost was fast (load 487ms prod, video readyState 4, scroll OK,
  scrub 0→5 monotonic). Cause: accessing **`next dev`** (unminified, on-demand,
  uncacheable) **through a Cloudflare tunnel to a home machine** → JS/3D/video
  all re-pulled over limited upload bandwidth each load; page can't scroll until
  hydrated. Fixes: (1) `npm run build` + `npm start` (**production**, minified,
  cacheable) — needed a one-line fix first: `ScrubVideo` `title`/`subtitle` lacked
  defaults → TS build error in `GarimaImpact.tsx`; gave them `= ''`. (2) Added
  `headers()` in `next.config.ts` → `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000,
  immutable` for `*.mp4|*.webm` so Cloudflare caches the clip at edge (was
  `max-age=0` = re-tunnelled every load). (3) Video 11→**7MB** (1080p crf24).
  Caveat: stable filenames + immutable cache → bump name / purge CF cache when
  re-encoding. Inherent limit: tunnelling a self-host has bandwidth/latency caps;
  real fix for public use = deploy to Vercel/CF Pages.
- **Pre-existing (separate):** navbar prefetches 404 — `/about/{staff,strength,
  committee,vision,mission,establishment,quality}` are linked but not built.
- **Verified** scrub on `/robotics` (`tools/caprobotics.mjs`): video 2560×1440,
  currentTime advances with scroll, no errors.
- Scripts: `tools/lab_final2.py` (render), `tools/integrated_render.py` (single
  frame), `tools/font_samples.py`. Blender 5.1: EEVEE id is `BLENDER_EEVEE`;
  Action fcurves via `action.layers[].strips[].channelbags[]`.

## 2026-06-22 — Mobile page CRASH when scrolling into the robot scrub video

**Symptom (real device):** on a phone, scrolling down to the robot disassembly
video crashed the whole page/Next.js; after a reload the scrub no longer felt
smooth (ScrollTrigger pin state left corrupted by the crash).

**Root cause:** GPU/decoder memory exhaustion. The hero school WebGL canvas (16MB
GLB + HDR-PMREM environment + retina dpr) stays mounted for the whole page. When
you scroll down, the pinned `ScrubVideo` seeks `video.currentTime` on essentially
every scroll frame — very heavy on a mobile VP9 decoder. The two heavy GPU
consumers coexisting overran mobile GPU memory → context loss → page crash.

**Fix (keep the scrub on mobile — it's wanted there):** instead of dropping the
mobile scrub, FREE the competing memory. `SchoolModelBanner.tsx` now watches the
hero with an `IntersectionObserver` and UNMOUNTS the `<Canvas>` (`canvasMounted`
state) once it scrolls out of view (`rootMargin 250px`), releasing the WebGL
context + all its GPU memory; it remounts when the hero returns. The drag rotation
lives in a ref, so it survives the remount. By the time you reach the robot/lab
videos, the hero GPU memory is free, so the decoder has the headroom to scrub
without OOM-crashing. Verified on a 412×915 dpr-3 mobile profile: canvas count goes
1 (top) → 0 (at the video, freed) → 1 (back at top), the robot video still scrubs
(`currentTime` tracks scroll), no crash, no page errors; desktop scrub unchanged.
[Note: an interim fix that switched mobile to a plain autoplay-loop was reverted —
the user wants the scroll animation on mobile too.]

---

## 2026-06-22 — Polish round: mobile model quality, journey blank, footer, drag button, robot eyes

**1. School model looked poor on phone.** Two causes. (a) The mobile budget
(`dpr 1`, `antialias:false`) gave jagged edges → restored antialias + `dpr [1,2]`.
(b) The bigger one: dropping the HDR `<Environment preset="sunset">` on mobile made
the materials flat/washed-out — that HDR is what made it "look great." The reason
it had been dropped was that, sitting inside the model's `<Suspense>`, its CDN fetch
FROZE the model on the spinner. **Final fix (`SchoolModelBanner.tsx`): keep the HDR
on every device but put it in its OWN `<Suspense fallback={null}>`, separate from
the model's.** The model now paints the instant its GLB loads, and the HDR lighting
pops in a moment later without ever blocking. Only real-time SHADOWS stay
desktop-only (the heavy 2K shadow map, barely visible on a small island).
[Superseded an interim attempt that used a `<hemisphereLight>` + desktop-only env —
that looked flat, hence this revision.]

**2. "Our Journey" section blank on phone until ~5 scrolls.** Root cause
(`Madok.tsx`): the card reveal was a GSAP ScrollTrigger, and the robot `ScrubVideo`
directly above is PINNED for 300% of the viewport — that huge pin-spacer throws
ScrollTrigger's start/end math off on real mobile, so the cards stayed at
`opacity:0` (blank) until well past the section. **Final fix: drive the card reveal
with a plain `IntersectionObserver`** (in a `useEffect`, threshold 0.12) that flips
a `revealed` state toggling Tailwind `opacity/translate` transitions with a per-card
stagger — completely independent of ScrollTrigger pin geometry, so the cards appear
the moment the grid enters view (falls back to visible if IO is unavailable). The
progress bar keeps its own snappy GSAP scrub. [Superseded an interim attempt that
just retriggered the GSAP reveal on `.journey-grid` — still pin-affected on device.]

**3. Footer stacked vertically on mobile.** Base grid was `grid-cols-1`
(`Footer.tsx`). Changed to `grid-cols-2` (kept `lg:grid-cols-4`) so the four
columns sit side-by-side like desktop — 4-across is too cramped at 390px, 2×2 is
the readable middle ground.

**4. Drag button below the fold on load (PC + mobile).** The model section was tall
and a wavy SVG separator + large margins pushed the handle out of the first
viewport. Fix (`SchoolModelBanner.tsx`): removed the separator, tightened heights
(`h-[450px]…lg:h-[760px]` → `h-[380px]…lg:h-[680px]`), pulled the canvas down
(`bottom-12`→`bottom-4`), reduced button/text margins (`mt-6`→`mt-3`). Handle +
"Drag To View" now render in the initial viewport on both.

**5. Academic robot had "no eyes" (looked like the wrong robot).** It was NOT a
wrong/replaced model — it's the same animated `robot.glb`. Its `eyes` material
ships with `emissiveFactor = [1,1,1]` (full white emissive) layered over its
baseColorTexture, blowing the eyes out to flat white ovals and hiding the actual
colored/pupilled eyes baked into the texture — the same Blender-baked-emissive
blowout that hit the school model. Fix: added an optional `dimEmissiveMaterials`
prop to `Character.tsx` that zeroes emissive (factor + map) on the named materials,
and passed `['eyes']` for the robot in `AcademicScene.tsx`. The textured blue eyes
are back and all three animations (idle/talk/wave) are preserved. Deliberately did
NOT swap to `final_robot.glb` — GLB inspection shows it has **0 animation clips**
(plus eyes-rigged-to-chest in bind pose), so it would freeze the conversation scene.

---

## 2026-06-22 — Madok scroll lag, real model on phone (poster reverted), robot-scrub pin hardening

**1. "Our Journey" (Madok) — reveal lagged ~1s behind the scroll.**
Root cause (`Madok.tsx`): the journey timeline used `scrub: 1` (1s smoothing) over
a long range (`top 86%`→`top 30%`) with a slow stagger (each `0.16`, dur `0.28`),
so cards drifted in well after the scroll position. Fix: `scrub: 0.2`, shorter
range (`top 82%`→`top 58%`), tighter stagger (each `0.07`, dur `0.18`). The reveal
now tracks the scroll instead of trailing it. (Snappiness is subjective — verified
no errors + cards still reveal in sequence with the progress bar.)

**2. REVERSAL — phone now renders the REAL 3D model + drag (poster removed).**
The earlier mobile **poster** fallback (`/school-poster.png`, Canvas gated to
≥768px) was reverted: the user reported the crash *still* happened with the poster
(so the WebGL model wasn't the sole cause) and wanted the real model + drag on
phones like PC. Fix (`SchoolModelBanner.tsx`): the Canvas mounts on every device;
`isDesktop` now only selects render QUALITY to keep phones inside their GPU memory
budget — mobile gets `dpr 1` (no retina oversampling), `shadows={false}` (no 2K
shadow map/depth pass), `powerPreference:'low-power'`, no `<Environment>` (skips
the sunset HDR download + its PMREM target; ambient+directional carry the lighting
instead, nudged brighter). Added direct pointer/touch drag on the canvas wrapper
with `touch-action: pan-y` (vertical swipe scrolls the page, horizontal drag spins
the model); drag handle + hint now show on all sizes; GLB preload is unconditional.
Verified on a 390×844 touch viewport: canvas mounts (no context loss), the real
island + thruster flames paint, a horizontal swipe yaws the model, no page errors.
Desktop path unchanged (shadow + HDR env still active).

**3. Robot scrub "broken" on home — pin geometry hardened.**
The user attributed a robot-scrub regression to the GarimaImpact `-mt-20/-mt-32`
torn-paper overlap shifting layout. Automated probes show the ping-pong scrub
works mechanically AND visually on both desktop (assembled→exploded→reassembled at
currentTime 1.25→7.78→5.74→0.00) and mobile (0.40→6.92→6.60→0.51), so the reported
break didn't reproduce — consistent with the global `ScrollRefresh` masking stale
pin geometry. Hardened defensively (`ScrubVideo.jsx`): added
`invalidateOnRefresh: true` (recompute pin start/end on every refresh, so a
sibling layout shift can't leave the pin measured against stale geometry) plus
`anticipatePin: 1`.

## 2026-06-21 — Follow-up tweaks: model pitch clamp + size, light-streak teleport, robot text, impact overlap

**1. Home model — clamp pitch, keep yaw free, make it bigger again.**
The fully-free rotation let the school somersault bottom-to-top (looked broken),
and the bounding-sphere-diagonal fit had made the model too small to view up
close. Fix (`SchoolModelBanner.tsx`): re-clamp `rotation.x`
(`ROT_X_MIN/MAX = -0.85/-0.15`) so it can't flip; leave `rotation.y` free for a
full horizontal spin. Because pitch is bounded, the only 360° turn is yaw, so
re-fit to the **horizontal span** (`scale = 7.6 / hypot(size.x, size.z)`) instead
of the full diagonal — the model is large/up-close again and a full horizontal
spin still stays in-frame. Section height bumped
(`lg:h-[740px]→h-[900px]`, etc.) for cloud clearance. Verified the school keeps
orientation on all drags, is large + visible on load (800/950px), clears clouds.

**2. Vision cards — glitch → "light-streak phase" teleport.**
User rejected the glitch (slice/RGB tear). Replaced with a cleaner teleport
(`VisionCards.tsx`, `globals.css`): removed `gvv-glitch-*`; added
`.is-charging` (hover: cyan glow + one `gvv-streak-sweep` light streak) and
`.is-phasing` (click). Click runs a GSAP timeline that collapses the card to a
thin bright horizontal line of light (`scaleY:0.04`), white-flashes, then expands
the streak sideways and fades (`scaleX:1.6, opacity:0`) → `router.push`; siblings
phase out. Verified classes fire and click → `/robotics`.

**3. Robot section — removed "MECHANICS IN MOTION" text.** Dropped the
`title`/`subtitle` props on the robot `<ScrubVideo>` in `GarimaImpact.tsx`
(ScrubVideo renders no overlay when both are absent).

**4. Garima Impact — transparent top overlaps the section above.** The
`Group 9.png` torn-paper section's transparent top showed a flat dark band
"mixing" at the seam with VisionCards. Added `-mt-20 md:-mt-32` + `z-20` so the
torn top overlaps the cards section — the transparency now reveals the cards
through the rip. Verified the Discover buttons sit clear of the tear.

## 2026-06-21 — Vision cards: rotational tilt → sci-fi glitch "teleport"

**Request.** Replace the home vision cards' mouse-follow 3D **rotational** tilt
with a **teleportation** effect (sci-fi glitch), on hover + click.

**Change** (`VisionCards.tsx`, `src/app/globals.css`):
- Removed the `onComplete` mousemove `rotationX/rotationY` `quickTo` tilt and the
  black-hole click suck-in (`scale:0, rotationZ:1080, blur`).
- Added CSS glitch keyframes `gvv-glitch-slice` (clip-path slice displacement +
  X jitter) and `gvv-glitch-rgb` (stacked cyan/magenta `drop-shadow` channel
  split), toggled via `.is-glitching` (0.4s one-shot hover burst) and
  `.is-teleporting` (fast infinite, used during the click-out).
- **Hover** (`onMouseEnter`): re-arm + add `.is-glitching` (reflow forces restart
  on rapid re-entry); `onMouseLeave` removes it. Settles into the existing
  `group-hover` calm state (lift + glow + sliding shutters), which was untouched.
- **Click**: add `.is-teleporting`, run a GSAP timeline (flicker → white-flash
  `brightness(3)` → blink-out `scaleY:0.02/opacity:0`), fade the other two cards,
  then `router.push(href)` in `onComplete`.

**Verified** with `tools/_cards.mjs`: hover toggles `.is-glitching`; click adds
`.is-teleporting` and navigates (URL → `/robotics`). Screenshots confirm the
slice/RGB-split tear on hover and the centered teleport-out on click, with a clean
resting + settled-hover state (no glitch residue).

## 2026-06-21 — Home 3D model: free rotation + fit so a spin never clips the frame

**Symptom.** Dragging the home floating-island model pushed it out of bounds /
cut it off at the canvas edges and it drifted up into the cloud layer. An earlier
in-progress attempt added rotation **clamps** (`ROT_X_MIN/MAX`, `ROT_Y_MIN/MAX`),
but that blocked rotating the model on all axes — which the user explicitly wanted.

**Cause.** Two things: (1) the model was scaled to its **longest axis**
(`6.2 / maxAxis`) so it nearly filled the frame at rest — any rotation swung its
corners (the bounding-sphere diagonal, larger than any single axis) past the
canvas edges and clipped. (2) The clamps that "fixed" the clipping also removed
the user's ability to freely turn the island.

**Fix** (`src/components/landing/SchoolModelBanner.tsx`):
- **Removed the clamps** — `moveDrag` now adds to `rotationTarget.x/y` directly, so
  the island rotates freely on all axes.
- **Re-fit by the bounding-sphere diagonal** instead of the longest axis:
  `scale = MODEL_FIT(6.6) / size.length()`. The model's rotated footprint (worst
  case = the diagonal) now fits the canvas with margin, so a full free spin on any
  axis stays in-frame and clears the clouds.

Verified with `tools/_draghandle.mjs` (drags the actual `.drag-handle` to the
extremes on each axis) + a clean `caplan.mjs` rest capture: model stays inside the
frame and below the clouds while rotating on every axis.

---

## 2026-06-21 — Content restructure: videos relocated, responsive fill, robot reassembly

**Changes (user-requested restructure):**
- **Robot disassembly video → home only.** Moved off `/robotics`; now a pinned
  scroll-scrubbed section in `GarimaImpact.tsx`, directly above "Innovation At
  Garima". `/robotics` no longer shows the robot.
- **Lab fly-through → /robotics.** Moved off `/co-curricular`; now the scrubbed
  section on `/robotics`.
- **/co-curricular → blank** page with generic demo text (navbar kept).
- **Contact Us section removed** from the home page.
- Introduced a shared **`src/components/shared/ScrubVideo.jsx`** (pinned, scrubbed,
  `100svh` + `object-cover` so footage fills the screen in portrait) used by both
  the home robot section and the robotics lab section.

**Robot "disassembles but never reassembles" — root cause & fix.**
Scrubbing `robot_assembly.webm`'s `currentTime` all the way to its end (10.13s =
full duration) shows the robot **still exploded** — the clip is assemble→explode
and *ends exploded*; it contains **no reassembly frames**. So any plain forward
scrub disassembles and stops. Since re-rendering wasn't wanted, `ScrubVideo` got a
**`pingPong`** option: it maps scroll progress 0→1 to a triangle wave
(`1 - |2·progress − 1|`), playing the clip forward to the explosion at mid-scroll
then reversing back to fully assembled at the bottom. Net scroll-down reading:
assembled → disassemble → reassemble (lands assembled right at "Innovation At
Garima"). Verified by the currentTime triangle-wave (0→8.2s→0) and frames.

**/academic model "not loading" on responsive — root cause & fix.**
The two characters are hard-placed at `x = ±80` with a fixed camera. The camera's
*horizontal* FOV is `vfov × aspect`, so on narrow/portrait viewports (aspect < ~0.95)
both characters fell outside the frustum and nothing rendered — looked like the
scene never loaded. Fix: made the separation aspect-responsive in the per-frame
camera driver — `sep = clamp(60 × aspect, 32, 80)` — pulling the pair toward centre
as the viewport narrows (camera stays at x=0, so they stay centred and large).
Section also switched `h-screen` → `h-[100svh]`. Verified at 390×844 (loads,
centred, dialogue cycles) and desktop unchanged.

**Exhaust flames longer + more contrasted.** `SchoolModelBanner.tsx`: thrust-cube
`ELONGATE` 3.5→5.5 (longer plume geometry); shader axial falloff softened
(`pow(1-a, 0.55)`) so the jet stays bright much further down; deeper saturated cyan
(`uColor` 0.0,0.52,1.0) with a sharper hot-core→cyan transition and a second
saturation lift down the plume for higher contrast against the bright sky.

**Responsive fill (global).** `100svh` + `object-cover` on the video sections;
school hero and academic characters verified filling portrait.

## 2026-06-21 — `/academic` conversation lost: `overflow-hidden` broke `position: sticky`

**Symptom:** After moving the academic walkthrough from drei `ScrollControls` to
window scroll, the scroll-driven robot↔student conversation no longer played. The
3D scene scrolled off the top almost immediately (blank viewport by ~50% scroll),
so no dialogue/animation stage was ever reached on screen.

**Root cause:** `AcademicScene` pins its canvas with a `position: sticky` section
inside a `height: 300vh` wrapper. `PageShell` (the academic page's wrapper) had
`overflow-hidden` on its outermost div. An ancestor with `overflow: hidden` turns
that ancestor into the sticky element's scroll container — but it grows with its
content instead of scrolling, so the sticky child never pins relative to the
viewport and just scrolls away with the page.

**Fix:** Changed `PageShell`'s outer div from `overflow-hidden` to
`overflow-x-clip`. `overflow: clip` (unlike `hidden`) does **not** establish a
scroll container and does not force the cross-axis to `auto`, so horizontal
overflow is still clipped while `position: sticky` works again. Verified at
0/25/50/75/100% scroll: scene pins, robot plays `talk`, boy plays `clap`, and the
dialogue panels (`QUALITY OF EDUCATION`, `VISION STATEMENT`, …) appear in sequence
(`tools/capscroll.mjs`). Affects every `PageShell` page (about/admission/contact/
academic); horizontal-scroll containment preserved.

---

## 2026-06-21 — Card-link pages (`/robotics`, `/co-curricular`) had no navbar

**Symptom:** Reaching `/robotics` or `/co-curricular` from the home VisionCards
showed the page with no site navigation — no way back without the browser button.

**Root cause:** Those two pages render their own full-bleed `<main>` and never used
`PageShell` (which is what mounts `<Navbar />`).

**Fix:** Added an absolute-positioned `<Navbar />` overlay (`absolute top-0 inset-x-0
z-50`) at the top of each page's `<main>` (made `<main>` `relative`). Kept them out
of `PageShell` on purpose so the GSAP-pinned full-screen video sections aren't
constrained by PageShell's column/footer/padding. Verified the navbar renders and
the hero/pin layout is unchanged on both pages (`tools/caplan.mjs`).

---

## 2026-06-21 — `/co-curricular` blanked on first-load scroll; scrub dropped on scroll-up

**Symptom:** (a) On a *cold* first load, scrolling made the whole page go blank; a
reload fixed it permanently. (b) Scrolling back up after scrolling down sometimes
dropped the video scrubbing / showed blank frames.

**Root cause:**
1. **Blank-on-first-load:** the scroll-scrubbed lab video's `ScrollTrigger`
   (`pin: true`) was created **asynchronously**, gated on the video's
   `loadedmetadata`. On a cold load that event fires at an unpredictable time
   relative to layout, so the pin geometry (start/end + pin-spacer) was measured
   wrong and the full-screen black pinned section ended up covering the viewport —
   and stayed wrong for the whole session. A reload serves the video from cache so
   `readyState >= 1` synchronously inside `useGSAP`, making the measurement correct.
   (`/co-curricular` also lacked the `ScrollRefresh` that `/academic` has.)
2. **Scroll-up scrub loss:** `onUpdate` wrote `video.currentTime` on *every* tick
   with no guard, flooding the decoder with backward seeks (expensive for webm),
   which dropped/blanked frames on fast scroll-ups.

**Fix (both `co-curricular/page.js` and the identical `robotics/page.js`):**
- Create the `ScrollTrigger` **immediately** in `useGSAP` (no metadata gate) so pin
  geometry is measured at a consistent initial layout.
- Drive `video.currentTime` from the eased `self.progress` (`progress * duration`),
  reading `duration` lazily and guarding `NaN` — removes the need to know duration
  at creation time.
- Skip seeks while one is in flight: `if (!video.seeking && |currentTime - target|
  > 0.02) video.currentTime = target` — stops the decoder flood, smoothing both
  directions.
- On `loadedmetadata`: paint the first frame (`currentTime = 0.001`) so the pinned
  black section doesn't show pre-scroll, then `ScrollTrigger.refresh()`.

Verified with cold-load incremental wheel scrolling down **and** back up
(`tools/capscrub.mjs`): scrub tracks both directions, no blank frames, navbar present.

## 2026-06-20 — Robotics robot's eyes were on its chest → switched model to robot.glb

**Symptom:** Once the robot was visible (see entry below), its eyeballs floated on the
**chest**, below the neck; the face had only empty sockets.

**Root cause:** `final_robot.glb`'s rig is broken. The eye meshes are skinned to a
mis-posed bone, so the bind/rest pose places them on the chest. This is baked into the
asset — proven by: (a) the displacement is identical at `scale=1` and `scale=40` (a
uniform scale can't move parts relative to the body, so it's not a three.js
skinned-under-scale bug); and (b) `skeleton.pose()` (reset to bind pose) collapses the
whole model to a speck, i.e. the intended display pose *is* the broken one. Not fixable
in code without re-rigging in Blender.

**Fix:** Switched `RobotShowcase.jsx` to **`robot.glb`** — the same GVV-branded robot
already used on `/academic`, which renders correctly with eyes on the face. Reframed for
the showcase camera: `ROBOT_SCALE = 0.4`, `ROBOT_Y = -1.2` (robot.glb is much larger
natively than final_robot). Verified by screenshots at two scroll depths: robot is
centred, eyes are on the face, and it rotates with scroll (`tools/caprobot.mjs`).

---

## 2026-06-20 — Robotics robot was invisible (shipped "done" but never visually checked)

**Symptom:** `/robotics` `.robot-section` rendered only the dark background + the
"MECHANICS IN MOTION" overlay — no robot. The Task 3 report had marked it done but
explicitly noted the robot "was not visually inspected — only confirmed indirectly via
the absence of a failed GLB request." It never actually rendered.

**Two stacked root causes:**
1. **Sub-millimetre model scale.** `final_robot.glb` is authored tiny — its *rendered*
   height is ~0.075u (the glTF accessor bbox reads ~0.0003u; it's a skinned mesh so the
   bind-pose bbox understates the real size, which also makes a `Box3.setFromObject`
   auto-fit misfire). At `scale={1.5}` the robot was a ~15px speck near the bottom edge.
2. **`<Environment preset="city" />` blocked the Suspense.** drei fetches the HDR from
   `raw.githack.com`, which returns a **301 redirect** that three's HDR loader doesn't
   follow → that `<Suspense>` never resolved → the whole subtree (including the robot)
   never mounted. (The GLB still 200'd, but only because of the module-level
   `useGLTF.preload`, which masked the problem — no `REQFAIL` ever appeared.)

**Fix (`src/components/scene/RobotShowcase.jsx`):**
- Empirically scaled the robot to ~3u tall: `ROBOT_SCALE = 40`, `ROBOT_Y = -1.0`
  (measured the real rendered size by logging `Box3.setFromObject` from a `useEffect`).
- **Removed `<Environment preset="city" />`** (and its import). The explicit
  ambient + directional + two coloured point lights already light the robot, and this
  drops a flaky external-CDN dependency from a core page element.

**Lesson:** "no failed request" ≠ "it renders." Always scroll the pinned section into
view and look at the pixels (`tools/caprobot.mjs`), don't infer from the network log.

## 2026-06-18 — School textures looked dim/olive vs the Blender render

**Symptom:** The school building looked darker and more muted/olive than the warm,
sunlit golden-wood look in the Blender reference render.

**Root cause (partial):** Tone-mapping exposure was low (`0.85`) and ambient light
was dim/neutral (`0.3`), so the albedo read flat and cool. (The baked-emissive
"lit" look was also disabled earlier to kill the white-rectangle blow-out.)

**Fix:** In `SchoolModelBanner.tsx` raised `toneMappingExposure` `0.85 → 1.05` and
ambient light `0.3 → 0.55` with a warm tint (`#FFF1DD`). Building now reads as
warmer golden wood, closer to the render, without washing out the thruster flames.

**Note:** A real-time WebGL view won't perfectly match a Cycles/GI render. If a
closer match is needed, the next step is selectively re-enabling the baked
emissive/lightmap textures at low intensity (carefully, to avoid the old
white-rectangle blow-out).

---

## 2026-06-18 — 3D models blank & cards unclickable over LAN / custom domain

**Symptom:** On `localhost:3000` everything works. When opening the site from
another device on the LAN (`http://192.168.1.5:3000`, `http://10.0.0.251:3000`)
or via the domain `garima.tinu.pro`, the 3D models render as blank space and the
Academic / Robotics / Co-curricular cards don't respond to clicks. No errors in
the console.

**Diagnosis (evidence):**
- Page HTML, navbar, text, clouds all load fine — only the interactive/3D parts fail.
- Captured the R3F `<canvas>` size: `300x150` (the HTML default) over the LAN IP vs
  `1152x692` over localhost. The container around it WAS correctly sized (`1152x692`),
  so the canvas simply never got measured/initialised.
- Canvas existed but client effects never completed; buttons had no handlers →
  classic sign that **React hydration never finished** on the remote origin.
- Only the HMR websocket errored (`ws://…/_next/webpack-hmr` → `ERR_INVALID_HTTP_RESPONSE`).

**Root cause:** Next.js only serves its dev/client runtime to origins it trusts.
`next.config.ts` had `allowedDevOrigins` listing only an old IP (`72.61.224.202`).
The current LAN IPs and domain were **not** in the list, so Next blocked their
`/_next` dev resources → no hydration → blank canvases and dead buttons.

**Fix:** Added every access origin (and LAN wildcards) to `allowedDevOrigins` in
`next.config.ts`:
```ts
allowedDevOrigins: [
  '72.61.224.202', '192.168.1.5', '10.0.0.251',
  'garima.tinu.pro', '*.tinu.pro', '192.168.*.*', '10.0.*.*',
]
```
Restart the dev server after editing. Verified: canvas now `1152x692` and the
model renders on both LAN IPs.

**Note:** This only affects `next dev`. A production build (`next start`) has no
HMR and isn't subject to `allowedDevOrigins`. When you access the site from a NEW
host/IP/domain in dev, add it here.

## 2026-06-18 — `next build` fails: invalid `datasource` in prisma.config.ts

**Symptom:** `npm run build` → `Type error: Object literal may only specify known
properties, and 'datasource' does not exist in type 'PrismaConfig'`.

**Root cause:** This Prisma version's `defineConfig()` does not accept a
`datasource` key. The database URL belongs in `prisma/schema.prisma`
(`datasource db { url = env("DATABASE_URL") }`), not in `prisma.config.ts`.

**Fix:** Removed the `datasource` block from `prisma.config.ts`.

**Still open:** Build then fails later with `@prisma/client did not initialize yet`
on `/api/admission-enquiry` — the Prisma client hasn't been generated. Run
`npx prisma generate` before building (or it should run via a postinstall hook).

---

## 2026-06-18 — School model rendered "inside" the clouds

**Symptom:** The floating-island model overlapped the decorative cloud PNG; the
school building appeared to poke into the cloud instead of floating beneath it.

**Root cause:** The model sat at world origin while the cloud layer sits above it
on the page, so they intersected.

**Fix:** In `SchoolModelBanner.tsx`, lowered the model group
(`position={[0,-1.4,0]}`) so it sits below the cloud layer. Because lowering it
made the camera look down onto the roof (hiding the underside flames), the default
view rotation was tilted back to `{ x:-0.5, y:0.25 }` to keep the thruster jets
visible. Matches the reference composition (clouds above, island + jets below).

---

## 2026-06-18 — Pointer (hand) cursor disappeared over the "Discover" buttons

**Symptom:** On the home-page Academic / Robotics / Co-curricular cards, hovering
the card showed the hand cursor, but moving onto the gold "Discover" button
reverted to the default arrow.

**Root cause:** `<button>` defaults to `cursor: default`. The card wrapper had
`cursor-pointer` but the button didn't, so the button overrode it.

**Fix:** Added `cursor-pointer` to the button's className in `VisionCards.tsx`.

---

## 2026-06-18 — /academic walkthrough required too many scrolls

**Change:** Reduced `ScrollControls pages={6}` → `pages={2}` in
`AcademicScene.tsx` so the guided tour completes in roughly one scroll.
(`pages={1}` would disable scrolling entirely — 2 is the practical minimum.)
The dialogue stages are keyed to scroll *offset* (0–1), so they still all play;
they're just compressed into a shorter scroll distance.
